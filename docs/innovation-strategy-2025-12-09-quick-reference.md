## 🎯 ONE-LINE STRATEGY

Build intelligence features for YOUR eyes → Become organizational intelligence broker → Let organic demand emerge from visible effectiveness

---

## 💡 THE BIG IDEA

**Problem:** Extremely siloed engineering org → Knowledge fragmentation → Highly-tagged insiders hoard domain knowledge

**Solution:** Personalized engineering awareness intelligence platform

**Your Angle:** Tool makes YOU intelligence hub → Information asymmetry = power → Career leverage

**Not:** Product for mass adoption  
**But:** Personal tool that demonstrates value through YOUR interventions

---

## 🚀 PHASE 1: CORE INTELLIGENCE BUILD (Weeks 1-8)

| Week | Feature | Goal | Success Metric |
|------|---------|------|----------------|
| 1-2 | **Expertise Discovery Engine** | "Who knows about X?" | 10+ queries/week lead to routing |
| 3-4 | **Decision Archaeology** ⭐ | Surface past discussions | 5+ debates ended with context |
| 5-6 | **Code Territory Radar** | "Who's working where?" | 2+ collisions detected/week |
| 7-8 | **Activity Summaries** | Truth about work patterns | 3+ proactive unblocking interventions |

**Week 8 Decision Gate:** GO (daily usage + 15+ interventions) | PIVOT | KILL

---

## 🎯 PHASE 2: BROKERAGE OPERATIONS (Weeks 9-16)

### Daily Routine (45 min total)
1. **Morning Scan (15 min):** Check activity summaries, territory radar, patterns
2. **Pattern ID (10 min):** Duplicates? Expertise needs? Overlaps? Stalled work?
3. **Intervene (15 min):** Slack/comment connecting people, preventing waste
4. **Document (5 min):** Log intervention, track acceptance/impact

### 5 Intervention Types
1. **Expertise Routing:** "Sarah knows auth (47 commits) - tagging her"
2. **Duplicate Prevention:** "Alex & Jordan both in billing - sync?"
3. **Decision Context:** "We decided this 6 months ago in #123"
4. **Proactive Unblocking:** "MR stalled 4 days - need help?"
5. **Knowledge Transfer:** "Jordan has expertise here (23 issues closed)"

### Targets
- **Weeks 9-10:** 10+ interventions, 50% acceptance, 3+ "how did you know?"
- **Weeks 11-12:** 10+ interventions, 60% acceptance, 5+ questions
- **Weeks 13-14:** 100+ hrs saved cumulative, 5+ colleagues curious
- **Weeks 15-16:** 3-5 early adopters granted access (unsolicited requests)

**Week 16 Decision Gate:** GO (organic demand) | KEEP PERSONAL | PIVOT | KILL

---

## 📊 KEY METRICS AT A GLANCE

### Leading (Track Weekly)
- **Daily Usage:** 6-7 days/week by Week 4
- **Insights:** 3+ non-obvious insights per session
- **Interventions:** 5+/week by Week 9
- **Acceptance Rate:** 50%+ → 60%+
- **Curiosity:** "How did you know?" questions

### Lagging (Track Monthly)
- **Time Saved:** 50 hrs → 200 hrs → 500 hrs
- **Users:** 3-5 → 5-10 → 10-20 (if scaling)
- **Recognition:** Team-wide by Month 6
- **Career Impact:** Role expansion discussions by Month 12

## ⚠️ TOP 5 RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Tool doesn't reveal insights** | 30% | Test early: "Can't find manually in 5 min?" If yes, valuable |
| **Interventions ignored** | 30% | Study patterns Week 9-10, double down on high-acceptance types |
| **AI dev ineffective** | 20% | Week 1 quality gate: If debugging >50% time, reduce AI usage |
| **No organic demand** | 30% | Accept it! Personal value = success, scaling optional |
| **Feature complexity spirals** | 25% | Hard rule: No feature >2 weeks, ship at 80%, iterate if needed |

---

## 🎲 SUCCESS DEFINITIONS

### Minimum Success (Week 8)
- ✅ Daily usage habit
- ✅ 15+ interventions
- ✅ Tool reveals non-obvious insights

### Target Success (Week 16)
- ✅ 40+ interventions
- ✅ 200+ hrs saved
- ✅ 3-5 colleagues using organically
- ✅ Recognized as intelligence hub

### Stretch Success (Month 6+)
- ✅ 10-20 active users
- ✅ Tool becomes critical infrastructure
- ✅ Career leverage (role expansion, recognition)

**Critical Insight:** ALL PATHS WIN because minimum success = makes YOU effective

---

## 🔑 CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Build for brokerage first** - Every feature decision: "Does this help me see patterns and connect people?"

2. **Value through action, not explanation** - Prove by DOING, not PITCHING

3. **Simplicity over sophistication** - No ML initially, clever queries + smart presentation

4. **Quiet launch, organic growth** - "Taylor's side project" not "Official Platform"

5. **Optionality preservation** - Path to broader adoption open but NOT required

6. **Kill fast if not working** - Week 8 honest assessment: Working? Yes → Continue. No/Maybe → KILL

---

## 🛠️ TECH STACK NOTES

**No ML Required Phase 1:**
- GitLab API queries (expertise graphs, activity patterns)
- PostgreSQL FTS (decision archaeology)
- Event stream analysis (stalled work, territory)
- AI-assisted development (rapid iteration)

**ML in Phase 2:**
- LLMs for semantic decision extraction
- Embedding models for duplicate detection
- Personalization algorithms learning from behavior

## 📅 DECISION GATES

| Week | Question | Criteria | Options |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| **4** | Features valuable? | Using 2+ features 3x/week | GO \| PIVOT \| REASSESS |
| **8** | Personal value? | Daily usage + 15+ interventions | GO Phase 2 \| PIVOT \| KILL |
| **12** | Brokerage working? | 20+ interventions, recognized by 3+ | CONTINUE \| PIVOT |
| **16** | Scale or stay personal? | 3+ requests, 2+ adopters | GO Phase 3 \| KEEP PERSONAL |
| **Month 6** | Long-term direction? | Assess users/impact/burden | Official \| Niche \| Personal \| Hand off |

---

## 💼 CAREER POSITIONING

**Not:** "I built a tool"  
**But:** "I learned to see and influence organizational patterns" (leadership skill)

**Frame:** Vehicle for developing organizational leadership, not just coding

**Outcome:** Recognized intelligence hub → Influence without authority → Career capital

---

## 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS (START HERE)

### Day 1 (Today)
1. ✅ Validate GitLab API data availability
   - Test commit history with file paths
   - Test comment/issue/MR access
   - Identify any critical gaps

2. ✅ Design expertise data schema
   - PostgreSQL tables for user_expertise
   - Indexes for file path patterns

### Week 1
3. Build Expertise Discovery MVP
   - GitLab API integration
   - Expertise scoring algorithm
   - Basic search UI

### Weekly Cadence
- Monday: Review velocity, adjust scope
- Friday: Ship or reassess feature
- Sunday: Document learnings, plan next week

---

## 🧭 WHEN IN DOUBT

**Ask:**
- Does this help MY brokerage capability?
- Can I ship this in <2 weeks?
- Would I find this insight manually in 5 min?

**If answer is NO:** Don't build it

**If stuck:** Re-read Executive Summary + Quick Reference (this doc)

---

## 📞 REMEMBER

> **"This is not a product play. This is a POWER play."**
>
> You're not building for users. You're building organizational leverage through information asymmetry.
>
> Invest time building intelligence infrastructure → Capture organizational leverage → Translate to influence/advancement/impact.

**Minimum success = makes YOU effective. Everything else is optional upside.**
